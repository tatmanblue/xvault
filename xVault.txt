XVault 
==================

This program secures files by encrypting them and the providing a means for the user to access them. 

When a file is put in the vault the original file is overwritten with random data before it is deleted. 

The vault can extract the file, call a program to use the file and then update the vault with the updated file. 

The vault is written so that it can be compiled for windows, pocket pc, and linux.

The code can be downloaded from http://www.microobjects.com/xvault

Development plans
===================

Command version first:
At first, the database will written to the harddrive unencrypted without using a vault key
The point is to get it working (adding files, etc...) first
Then the database will only appear on the harddrive encrypted and unencrypted in memory only

Followed by some GUI wrappers
